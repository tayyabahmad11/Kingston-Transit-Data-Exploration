# Kingston Transit Data Exploration

An analysis of the Kingston bus transit system in the city of Kingston, Ontario and how accessible it is to the residents of the different counties in the area. Using plotting methods on the public data sets we present an in-depth analysis of the accessibility of the transit system, suggestions on how the city could improve the transit system to reduce the usage of cars, and an analysis of the redundancy of certain bus routes.
